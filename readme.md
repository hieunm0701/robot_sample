  preceded with a semicolon (;).

3. Install package, go to root folder (robot_cloudcath),
* Install virtualenv
  * Open the Start menu and start the Command Line app.
  * Type the following pip command in the console:


    `pip install virtualenv`
  * Active virtual environment:

    `run file venv/Scripts/activation.bat`

    `pip3 install -r ./resources/requirement.txt`

4. Install webdriver manager and download target browser driver to
   resources/drivers


    `pip install webdrivermanager`  
    `webdrivermanager firefox chrome --linkpath resources\drivers`

## Test execution on Mac/Windows
To run tests:

1. Activate virtual environment for Mac:

   `source ./venv/bin/activate`

2.  Activate virtual environment for Windows:

    `run file venv/Scripts/activation.bat`

3.  Run Tests:

    * To run all tests:

        `robot "<testfolder>"`

        `E.g:  robot testcases`

    * Run test file:

        `robot <path to test file>`

        `E.g: robot testcases/ViewPatient.robot`

    * Run single test:

        `robot -t "<Test case name>" <path to test file>`

        `E.g: robot -t "FR-157 The Admin user shall have a list based interface to patient data" testcases/ViewPatient.robot`
    * Run with browser test, we can add browser variable in command line
      (-v browser:chrome...) or change it in resources/constant.yaml,
      the value should be chrome/firefox/ie/edge:

        `robot -v browser:chrome -t "<Test case name>" <path to test
        file>`

        `E.g: robot -t "FR-157 The Admin user shall have a list based interface to patient data" testcases/ViewPatient.robot`

    * Run in parallel(pabot --processes *number of processes*):

        `pabot --processes 5 -v browser:chrome -t "<Test case name>"
        <path to test file>`
## What it is
This Python package adds support for [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) and Robot Framework's [SeleniumLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary). Though this package is a [Robot library](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#extending-robot-framework), it's usable outside the Robot context and facilitates use of the page object pattern independently of any Python testing framework. This means you can use it to create page objects and run tests in other testing frameworks like  [`unittest`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html), [lettuce](http://lettuce.it/tutorial/simple.html), etc.
